# C++ / Object-oriented programming

Those projects provide an introduction to fundamental concepts and principles of the C++ programming language.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a coding style focused on objects, which are instances of classes representing data and actions on that data. It highlights modular, reusable code components for better understanding, maintenance, and expansion.
